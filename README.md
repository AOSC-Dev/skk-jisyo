Unofficial Tracking Repository for SKK-JISYO
============================================

This repository is intended to aid AOSC OS maintainers with packaging
`skk-jisyo`. Upstream does not provide any sort of versioning or checksum
tracking, making it difficult to detect changes, or even to ensure
reproducibility.
